# a countdown timer project
  In this project I used an external javascript file(time.js) and an external css file(styles.css).
## HTML
  I used html 5 elements such as ```<main></main>```
## CSS
  Flex box was highly used to justify and align content in the body section.
## JavaScript
  the ```Date()``` function was used to get the exact date and time of the user
